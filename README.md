# Final-draft
This repository contains the draft version of my Final Project Paper for the course. The project's main focus is on designing and evaluating a conversational AI chatbot for a fictional online furniture store called Home Furnisherz.

The goal of the chatbot is to streamline customer communication by handling routine inquiries, reducing the workload on human customer service representatives, and to improve customer experience through fast, automated responses.
